  <h1>About Us</h1>


  <p>In September 2021, we decided to launch FoodHub after a realizing how delicious restaurant made 
    food, worth hundreds of
    dollars, was out of reach of many people not only because of money constraints, but also because 
    of the nobody ever thought that restaurant could serve people just by sharing their recipes, just 
    for people to try them home at times when they want to spend a family cooking night or simply more 
    time home. FoodHub was made with one aim to bring chef recipes to people straight from the restaurants
    that got their customers back.</p>
